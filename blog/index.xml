      <description>For my first project I decided to write a tool to help me earn virtual money(ISK) in Eve online.
Fighting(PVP) and taking contol of systems is one of the core elements in Eve online, each player has a spaceship with modules at their disposal to use in those fights. Getting those items can take quite a while, each player has to haul their ship with modules from a trade-hub(Jita) to their favorite system.</description>
